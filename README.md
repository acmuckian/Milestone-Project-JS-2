## User Requirements and Expectations

# Design 

## Colour Scheme 
![colour scheme for this website](images/Meet%20the%20Villagers.png)

The colour scheme was based on colours that predominantly feature in the game, Animal Crossing, from the colours in the logo to the grass texture. 

[WebAIM](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) was used for accessibility purposes to look at the contrast of the colours against each other.

## Typography 

The header font used for this website is the same as is used for the Animal Crossing logo, Fink Heavy, in order to instantly signal to the user that this is a website related to the popular series, Animal Crossing. 

The main body font used is Arvo, due to its similarities to the font, Rodin Bokutoh Pro which is a font developed by FontWorks and is used in the game Animal Crossing: New Horizons.
